# Customer_Churn
Customer churn is a critical issue for subscription-based businesses. Predicting which customers are at risk of leaving can help businesses take proactive steps to retain them, enhancing customer satisfaction and profitability. This project uses the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle to predict churn and provide actionable insights.

##Objectives:
*Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
*Data Visualization: Understand key features and their impact on churn.
*Model Building: Develop machine learning models to predict churn.
*Model Evaluation and Optimization: Assess and fine-tune model performance.
*Insights and Recommendations: Provide strategic insights to reduce churn.

##Key Steps
*Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Handled missing values, converted categorical variables to numerical, and scaled features.
*Data Visualization: Visualized tenure and monthly charges against churn.
*Model Building: Built a neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras.
*Model Evaluation: Evaluated model accuracy using test data.
*Model Optimization: Optimized the neural network for better performance.

##Technologies Used
*Python
*Pandas
*Matplotlib
*Scikit-learn
*TensorFlow/Keras
